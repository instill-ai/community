## Instill Core Projects

**Welcome to Instill Core** ‚Äì where the world of AI-first applications comes alive. Instill Core lays the foundation for AI-powered pipelines designed to handle unstructured data. Within this ecosystem, you'll find source-available projects that enable you to construct robust AI pipelines. Allow these tools to elevate your data processing capabilities, transforming raw data into actionable insights. To dive into the potential of Instill Core, head over to our [documentation](https://www.instill.tech/docs).

  **Instill VDP**, or **VDP (Versatile Data Pipeline)**, represents a comprehensive unstructured data infrastructure. Its purpose is to simplify the journey of processing unstructured data from start to finish:

  - **Extract:** Gather unstructured data from diverse sources, including AI applications, cloud/on-prem storage, and IoT devices.
  - **Transform:** Utilize AI models to convert raw data into meaningful insights and actionable formats.
  - **Load:** Efficiently move processed data to warehouses, applications, or other destinations.

  Embracing VDP is straightforward, whether you opt for Instill Cloud deployment or self-hosting via Instill Core. Consult our comprehensive [documentation](https://www.instill.tech/docs/core/vdp/deployment/overview) to delve into VDP deployment.

  <summary><b>üóø <a href="https://github.com/instill-ai/base" target="_blank">Instill Base</a>: Essential Services for VDP and Model</b></summary><br>

  **Instill Base**, or **Base**, serves as the bedrock upon which Instill projects thrive. Essential services such as user management servers, databases, and third-party observability tools find their home here. Base plays a pivotal role in facilitating the seamless launch of both VDP and Model. Additionally, it introduces [Console](https://github.com/instill-ai/console), a user-friendly web-based UI application that enhances accessibility and usability across VDP and Model.
